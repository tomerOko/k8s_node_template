cluster level stuff
-------------------
* what is the right way to manage ingress installation (not the files,
 the ingress itself, how does it work when moving to production)
    - there will allways be an 'cluster initialization' procces made manually or by CD (continius delivery) program,
    importing the kubernets.ingress-nginx.yaml file, and 'kubectl' apply it will be a stage in that CD procces 


deployments
-----------
* in a deployment: can I specify a docker file to build from instead of an image (that was already built manually)
    - skaffold / jenkins dose that for u

* there is somthing about deployment being also a load-balancer by defulat
    - yes. it just is, natively the deployment split and balance the load between it's replicas

* how dose deployments know how many instances to run? (in case 'replicas' property is not provided)
    - there is a thing with resources, that u specifiy a minimal resources (to give an instance from the beginning), 
    and a maximal resources that if an instance is asking for more, the deplotment shuld run another instance
    - and there is lika a scale 'strategies' for that, in the yaml one can provice a set of rules for the deplotment
    to scale by
